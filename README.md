# chef-powershell-shim

A .NET Assembly to facilitate communication between Chef and PowerShell on the Windows platform. This repo now also contains the chef-powershell Ruby gem which consumes the the .NET Assembly and provides the interface between Chef and PowerShell via ffi.

### Development Prerequisites

Binaries can be built with Habitat. See the PowerShell script `.\.expeditor\build_gems.ps1` to test your changes locally.

### Build on merge

(Broken due to credentials for pushing gem, but also `.\.expeditor\update_version.sh` appears to be broken as well.

`workflows/gem-build.yml` should normally build on merge to `main`

### Manual build

Then run `.\.expeditor\manual_gem_release.ps1` to build the gem and push it out. Releng does not have a Windows centric
facility to build and push gems to Artifactory automatically. You will need:
1) Access to the Chef internal Artifactory repo
2) a Windows build system

## Contributing/Development

Please read our [Community Contributions Guidelines](https://docs.chef.io/community_contributions.html), and
ensure you are signing all your commits with DCO sign-off.

The general development process is:

1. Fork this repo and clone it to your workstation.
2. Create a feature branch for your change.
3. Write code and tests.
4. Push your feature branch to github and open a pull request against master.

Once your repository is set up, you can start working on the code.  We do utilize
RSpec for test driven development, so you'll need to get a development
environment running. Follow the above procedure ("Installing from Git") to get
your local copy of the source running.
